<b><u>Create Github Account (Part A)</u></b>
<p>This part of the assignment is due <font color="red">no later than Friday, September 19, 11:59 pm</font>. Failure to complete this part on time may result in the inability to submit part B.</p>
<p>
We will be using a version control system called Git for lab submissions. Alongside Git, we will be using a common website for hosting Git repositories called Github. Go to <a href="https://www.github.com">Github</a> and create an account using your utexas.edu email address. Once you have completed your registration, fill in <a href="github_info.html">this form</a> with the information. We will be creating Github repositories for the students as a batch process. This process will be completed shortly after September 19, 11:59 pm. Until the process is complete, you will not be able to move on to part B.</p>

<b><u>Submit Lab Assignments (Part B)</u></b>
<p>Follow the <a href="http://maater.github.io/ee306-f14/Software/submission.html">submission instructions</a> carefully to set up your project submission folder. Open the file "lab0.txt". The first line in this file will be a question asking "What grade do you want in EE 306?". In the same file, write your answer on the next line in the form "I would like a ____ in EE 306", where the blank should be filled in with the numerical grade from 0-100 that you wish to make in the course.
</p>

<p>
Follow the submission instructions to save the file, commit it, and upload it back to Github. Verify that your file has been correctly submitted.
