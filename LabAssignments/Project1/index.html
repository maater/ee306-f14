    Programming Assignment 1<br>
    Due:  October 5th, 11:59 pm <br>

    <p>
	 You must do every programming assignment by yourself. You are permitted to
	 get help ONLY from the TAs and the instructor. When you have completed the
	 program, and tested it sufficiently so that you are comfortable that it
	 works on any input (i.e., value initially stored in x3100), submit it for
	 grading according to the submission instructions at the end of this handout.
</p><p><br><b><u>Counting the  number of 1s in a 16-bit Bit Vector
</u></b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Your Job:</b> 

The addressability of the LC-3 is 16 bits; i.e., each memory location contains
16 bits of data. In this assignment, you are asked to write a program in LC-3
machine language to count the number of 1s in a 16-bit word, and store the
result back in memory. Counting the number of occurrences of 1 means counting
the number of times the 1 shows up in the entire 16 bit word.
</p>

<p>
<b>Some examples:</b>
</p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     1111111111111110 has 15 occurrences of "1" <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     0101010101010101 has 8 occurrences of "1" <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     0000000100000000 has 1 occurrence of "1"  <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     1110110001100001 has 8 occurrences of "1" <br>

<p>
Your program should assume that the input word is stored in memory location
<b>x3100</b>. Your program should store the output count in memory location <b>x3101</b>.
Your program should start at memory location <b>x3000</b>, and should halt the
machine after storing the output to memory location <b>x3101</b>. So for example,
if the memory location x3100 contains the word 1110110001100001, then your
program should store the value 0000000000001000(which is 8 in decimal) in
memory location x3101, then halt.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Familiarize yourself with the software and documentation, and the
submission instructions well before the deadline so that you can get help
from a TA if you cannot figure out the mechanics by yourself. It is
unreasonable to expect Professor Suleman or a TA to help you submit your
program at 11:45pm on the day the program is due simply because you left
this for the last minute, and have discovered that you do not know how to
do it by yourself.
</p>
<p>
<b>Simulator/Testing Hint:</b> You can test your program by setting the value of
memory location x3100 before you run your program on the LC-3 simulator. On
Windows machines, you can click on "Simulate" on the menubar and select
"Set Value". You can also just press F4 and the "Set Value" dialog box will
pop up. Finally, double-clicking on the contents of a memory location will
also cause the "Set Value" dialog box to pop up.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you set a breakpoint before you run your program so that your
program will stop just before it executes the trap instruction. This will
allow you to examine the contents of x3101 after your program has finished
executing, but before control is turned over to the operating system to
halt your program.

</p>

Follow the following steps:
<ul>

<li> <b>Get count.bin from GitHub:</b> Follow the procedure on <a
href="http://maater.github.io/ee306-f14/Software/submission.html"> submission
instructions</a> under <b>Updating Your Submission Directory</b>  to get the
file <font color=red> count.bin </font> from GitHub. You will be writing your
program in the count.bin file. </li>

<li> <b>Write your program:</b> Open count.bin in the LC3Edit text editor. The
first line of your program must specify the memory address of the first
instruction of your program. For this assignment, you should place your program
starting at x3000 (i.e., the first line of your program should contain the bit
pattern 0011000000000000). Each subsequent line of your program will consist of
16 consecutive 0s and 1s corresponding to the bits of that instruction. For
example, you would represent the instruction to add the contents of R1 to the
contents of R2 and put the result in R0 by: 0001000001000010. A program
represented in this way is called a .bin file. </li>

<li><b>  Test your program:</b> First convert your .bin file to an .obj file. Then
load the .obj file into the LC-3 Simulator and test thoroughly by running
it with multiple different input values. Read the <a href =
https://maater.github.io/ee306-f14/software.html> Software and
	Documentation </a> section for more help on how to use the simulator. In the
real world, writing a program is never finished until the program has been
thoroughly tested on lots of different input data. In fact, thorough
testing separates the serious programmers from the dilettantes. Thorough
testing means using odd-ball data (we call them "corner cases"), not just
straightforward data.</li>

<li> <b> Submit your program:</b> The program you are to submit is the count.bin
file.  Follow the <a
href="http://maater.github.io/ee306-f14/Software/submission.html"> submission
instructions</a> procedure under <b>Submitting Your Program</b> for uploading
your count.bin file for grading.</li> </ul> Note: We understand that to test
your program, you must first create a .obj file. The .obj file is not to be
submitted for grading. We will create a .obj file from your .bin file when we
grade your program.
