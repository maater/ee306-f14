    <h3>Incorrect Submission Policy</h3>

<p>
A small number of students submitted their Lab 1 program incorrectly. For
example, they might have named their program incorrectly (e.g.,
reverse.bin.bin), or submitted their program into the wrong directory. Doing so
would have resulted in earning a zero on the original Lab 1 submission. <b>This
	only applies if a submission was actually made on-time, but simply
	incorrectly submitted.</b> If these conditions apply to you, read on.
</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Send an email to:</b> faruk@hps.utexas.edu
	<br/>The email should follow the following template:
	<br/><b>Subject:</b> EE306 Lab 1 incorrect submission for <b>your UT EID</b>
	<br/><b>Message body:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>The directory where you incorrectly submitted your program. For
		example, <code>uteid/Project10</code> instead of
		<code>uteid/Project1</code>.</li>
		<li>The filename given to your incorrect submission. For example,
		<code>reverse.bin.bin</code> instead of <code>reverse.bin</code>.</li> 
	</ol>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>That's it. No other action is required. You will not need to submit
	anything additional.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Grading Notes</h3>
<p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Despite our submission directions clearly stating that you will earn
	a zero if you fail to correctly submit, we have decided to impose a 40 point
	penalty on whatever grade you earn after getting your incorrect submission
	graded. This means you can change your score from a zero to as much as a 60
	on your original Lab 1 grade. We will not give you a negative score if you
	end up earning below a 40.</p></li>
	<li><p>After getting your corrected grade, note that the standard regrade
	policy for Lab 1 will still apply to you if you wish to use it. There are
	two cases: major changes, and minor changes. If you make a major change,
	whatever grade you earn on your regrade (0 through 100) will be averaged
	with your corrected grade (0 to 60), which results in a maximum score of 80.
	If you make a minor change, follow the minor change directions, and you will
	be able to earn up to a 70 (instead of a 90 for those students who submitted
	correctly, but are only fixing a minor change).</p></li>
	<li><p>If you decide to email, please adhere to the above guidelines. Emails
	not following it will be ignored, and you will retain your score of
	zero.</p></li>
</ol>
