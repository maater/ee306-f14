<b>Accessing the result file:</b> 
<br>

1. Go to www.ece.utexas.edu/~itcproj

<br>
2. Log in using your EID and the password you created for submitting the
  programming lab.

<br>
3. Click on the File Manager Page

<br>
4. In the list of files, you will find a file named <your EID>.result. For example, if my EID is abc123 then my file will be abc123.result. Click on this file and it will open the result file.

<br>
<br>
<b>Reading the result file: </b>

<br>
The result file contains a table. Each row in this table represents a test case. For each test case we list the input, the correct output, the output value from your simulator, whether or not you got this test case incorrect (a blank last column indicates that you got it correct).

<br>
There are a total of 50 test cases. Each test case is worth 2 points. Your total score is equal to two times the number of cases you got correct times.

<br>
At the bottom of the file you will find a line which states

<br>
 Score: <your EID> XX/100.

<br>
The XX is your score out of 100 on the first program.
