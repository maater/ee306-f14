    <h3>Policy</h3>

<p>
As discussed in class, there are two cases for the regrade:
<br>
<ol>
<li> If you make minor changes (e.g., adding/fixing an instruction to store the
result in x3101), you must send an email explaining what you fixed as specified
in the instructions below. If we agree that what you fixed was minor, you can
get up to 90 points. </li>

<li> If you make significant changes, (e.g. you rewrite the whole program), you
should not send any emails. You will get the average of the new grade and the
original grade.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Fix your program: Fix your program and name the file containing your
program reverse.regrade.bin.</li>

<li><p>Submit your program: <b>Submit your program in your Project 1 Directory.
	Follow the standard submission instructions page to do so. Start at the
	"Updating your Submission Directory" Step. You should see an empty
	"reverse.regrade.bin" file. Be sure to verify your submission using your
	internet browser.</b>
<!-- Follow the <a href=../../Software/submission.html>submission
	instructions</a> to upload the reverse.regrade.bin file.--></p></li>

<li><p>If you made major changes to your program, you are done and no further
action is required. However, if you fixed a minor error then you should read
on.</p></li>

<li><p>Email Comments: <b>If and only if</b> you made a <b><i>minor</i></b>
