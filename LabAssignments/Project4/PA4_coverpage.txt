Instructions: 
You must do the programming assignment by yourself. You are permitted to get help ONLY from
 the TAs and the instructor. When you have completed the program, and tested it sufficiently
 so that you are comfortable that it works on any input, submit it for grading according to
 the instructions. Submit your program at the end of this handout. 



The fourth programming assignment is to write a two-person game program that you can show 
your parents and play with your friends when you go home for Thanksgiving. You have two 
choices, and you will get full credit for successfully completing one of them, independent
of which one you choose to do. The two games are Connect-4 and Nim. Full specifications 
for the two game programs are contained in Connect-4 and Nim. We are told that the 
Connect-4 program is the more challenging of the two. It is completely up to you which you 
choose. A perfectly working Nim program will receive 100, while a half-working Connect-4 
program will receive at most 50, so use your own judgment as to which program you attempt.
