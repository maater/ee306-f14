	Professor Patt is trying to decide when he should shave his beard.
	Your job is to design a logic circuit whose output Y is equal to 1 when Professor Patt should shave his beard, and 0 when he should not. The circuit will receive three input variables (A, B, C) that answer three different yes/no questions (1=yes, 0=no).  
<br><br>
	A<=Has Professor Patt been uncomfortably warm this summer?
<br>
	B<=Does Professor Patt want a new, fresher look?
<br>
	C<=Are beards “cool”?
<br><br>
	We think that Professor Patt should shave his beard if he has been uncomfortably warm this summer. He should also shave his beard if he wants a new fresher look and beards are not “cool”.
<br>
	Write the logic equation for Y in terms of A,B,C that solves this problem, and draw the gate-level diagram.

Shown below are several logical identities with one item missing in each.
X represents the case where it can be replaced by either a 0 or a 1 and
the identity will still hold.  Your job: Fill in the blanks with either a 
0, 1, or X.
<p>

For example, in part a, the missing item is X.  That is 0 OR 0 = 0 and 
0 OR 1 = 1.

<li> 0 OR  X = ___
<li> 1 OR  X = ___

      Logic circuit 1 in Figure 3.36 (page 87 of the book) has inputs A, B,
      C. Logic circuit 2 in Figure 3.37 (page 87 of the book) has inputs A
      and B. Both logic circuits have an output D. There is a fundamental
	difference between the behavioral characteristics of these two
	circuits. What is it? <i>Hint</i>: What happens when the voltage at
	input A goes from 0 to 1 in both circuits? <br>

	A) Implement a 4-to-1 mux using only 2-to-1 muxes making sure to properly
	connect all of the terminals. Remember that you will have 4 inputs (A, B, C, and D), 2
	control signals (S1 and S0), and 1 output (OUT). After implementing the 4-1 mux, 
	fill in the truth table below. <br>	
	B) Implement F = A xor B using ONLY two 2-to-1 muxes. You are not allowed to use a not gate (A' and B' are not available).

	Say the speed of a logic structure depends on the largest number of logic
	gates through which any of the inputs must propagate to reach an output.
	Assume that a NOT, an AND, and an OR gate all count as one gate delay. For
	example, the propagation delay for a two-input decoder shown in Figure
	3.11 is 2 because some inputs propagate through two gates.
<ol type="a">
	<li>
	What is the propagation delay for the two-input mux shown in Figure 3.12 (page 61)?
	</li><li>
	What is the propagation delay for the 4-bit adder shown in Figure 3.16 (page 63)?
	</li><li>
	Can you reduce the propagation delay for the circuit shown in Figure 3
	by implementing the equation in a different way? If so, how?

	Recall that the adder was built with individual "slices" that produced
	a sum bit and carryout bit based on the two operand bits A and B and
	the carryin bit. We called such an element a full-adder. Suppose we
	have a 3-to-8 decoder and two six-input OR gates, as shown in Figure 3
	below. Can we connect them so that we have a full-adder? If so, please
	do. (<i>Hint</i>: If an input to an OR gate is not needed, we can
	simply put an input 0 on it and it will have no effect on anything. For
	example, see the figure below.)<br>

	  We wish to design a controller for an elevator such that if you push a button
	  for a desired floor, the controller will output the floor number that the elevator
	  should go to.  However, to deter lazy people from going up or down one floor,
	  if you push the button for the next floor (up or down), the elevator will stay on its
	  current floor. If you push the button for the same floor that you're currently on,
	  the controller will output the current floor number. There are four floors in the building.</p>
  <p>
  Your job: construct a complete truth table for the elevator controller.
  It is not necessary to draw the logic here; the truth table is sufficient.
  </p>
  Hint: What information does the controller need in order to output the floor
  to go to?
  </p>

  <p>
  Hint: How many input bits will that require.
  </p>

  <p>
  Hint: How many output bits will the controller have to supply.

We want to make a state machine for the scoreboard of the Texas vs. Oklahoma Football game. The following information is required to determine the state of the game:
 
<br> 
<br> 
1. Score: 0 to 99 points for each team
<br> 
2. Down: 1, 2, 3, or 4
<br> 
3. Yards to gain: 0 to 99
<br> 
4. Quarter: 1, 2, 3, 4
<br> 
5. Yardline: any number from Home 0 to Home 49, Visitor 0 to Visitor 49, 50
<br> 
6. Possesion: Home, Visitor
<br> 
7. Time remaining: any number from 0:00 to 15:00, where m:s (minutes, seconds)

<br> 
(a) What is the minimum number of bits that we need to use to store the state required?
<br>
(b) Suppose we make a separate logic circuit for each of the seven elements on the scoreboard, how many bits would it then take to store the state of the scoreboard?
<br>
(c) Why might the method of part b be a better way to specify the state than the method of part a?
