<p>
Jane Computer (Bob's adoring wife), not to be outdone
by her husband, decided to rewrite the <code>TRAP x22</code> handler at a different place in
memory. Consider her implementation below. If a user writes a program that uses this


<code>TRAP</code> handler to output an array of characters, how many times is the <code>ADD</code>

instruction at the location with label <code>A</code> executed? Assume that the
user only calls this "new" <code>TRAP x22</code> once. What is wrong with this <code>TRAP</code> handler?
Now add the necessary instructions so the <code>TRAP</code> handler executes properly.</p>

<p>Hint: <code>RET</code> uses <code>R7</code> as linkage back to the caller
(<code>RET</code> is equivalent to <code>JMP R7</code>).</p>

<pre><code>
; TRAP handler
; Outputs ASCII characters stored in consecutive memory locations.
; R0 points to the first ASCII character before the new TRAP x22 is called.
; The null character (x00) provides a sentinel that terminates the output sequence.

What are the defining characteristics of a stack? Give two implementations of a stack and describe their differences.
</li>      
<br>	
      <li>A zero-address machine is a stack-based machine where all operations are
	done by using values stored on the operand stack.  For this problem, you may
	assume that the ISA allows the following operations:<br>
	<br>
	PUSH M - pushes the value stored at memory location M onto the operand stack.<br>

	<br>
	POP M - pops the operand stack and stores the value into memory location M.<br>
	<br>
	OP - Pops two values off the operand stack and performs the binary operation OP
	on the two values. The result is pushed back onto the operand stack.<br>
	<br>
	Note: OP can be ADD, SUB, MUL, or DIV for parts a and b of this problem.<br>
	Note: See the <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/09f.306/ProblemSets/PS5/stack.html">stack machine</a> supplemental handout for help on this problem.<br>

	    u in terms of v, w, x, y, and z.  The values u, v, w, x, y, and z are stored in

    <li> (Adapted from 10.9) The input stream of a stack is a list of all the elements we pushed onto the stack, in the order that we pushed them.
	The input stream from Excercise 10.8 from page 284 of the book for example is ABCDEFGHIJKLM<br>

	The output stream is a list of all the elements that are popped off the stack in the order that they are popped off. <br>

	a. If the input stream is ZYXWVUTSR, create a sequence of pushes and pops such that the output stream is YXVUWZSRT. <br>
	b. If the input stream is ZYXW, how many different output streams can be created.<br>

    <li>
	(Adapted from 10.6) 
	Rewrite the PUSH and POP routines such that the stack on which they operate holds elements that take up two memory locations each.
	
	Assume we are writing a program to simulate a stack machine that manipulates 32-bit integers with the LC-3. We would need
	PUSH and POP routines that operate with a stack that holds elements which take up two memory locations each. Rewrite the PUSH and POP routines 
	for this to be possible.

	Note the signals labeled A through F. A is the memory enable signal, if it is 1 memory is enabled, if 
	it is 0, memory is disabled.  B, C, and D are the load enable signals for the Device Registers.  If the load 
	enable signal is 1, the register is loaded with a value, otherwise it is not. E is the 16-bit output of INMUX, and 
	F is the 2-bit select line for INMUX.<br>

	between one and three times (why?). The following table lists two consecutive
	instructions to be executed on the LC-3. Complete the table with the values

	performed by the instruction. If an instruction does not require three memory accesses, draw a line accross the unused accesses.

      <li>Note: This problem is NOT easy.  In fact, it took me a while to solve it, and I am
	supposed to be an expert on 306 material.  So, if you are struggling to pass this
	course, I suggest you ignore it.  On the other hand, if you are a hot shot and think
	no problem is beyond you, then by all means go for it.  We put it on the problem set
	to keep some of the hot shots out of mischief.  We would not put it on the final,
	because we think it is too difficult to put on the exam.<br>

	A programmer wrote this program to do something useful.  He, however, forgot to comment his code, 
	and now can't remember what the program is supposed to do.  Your job is to save him the trouble and 
	figure it out for him.  In 20 words or fewer tell us what valuable information the program below provides 
	about the value stored in memory location INPUT.  Assume that there is a non-zero value at location INPUT before the program is executed.<br>
	<br>
	HINT: When testing different values of INPUT pay attention to their bit
	patterns.  How does the bit pattern correspond to the RESULT?<br>
