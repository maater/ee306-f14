<hr>

<p>
For this class, you will need to use the LC-3 simulator for your programming
assignments. Since there are only two versions of the simulator, a Windows
version and a Linux version, it may be challenging to complete the programs if
you own a Mac.
</p>
<p>
Even if you do own a Mac, there are many options available to you. Using
software such as VM Ware, Parallels, or Boot Camp, you could install Windows 7
on your Mac and proceed to use the Windows LC-3 simulator.
</p>
<p>
Acquiring a copy of Windows can be expensive, but the Engineering Department's
IT Group offers a special deal with the Microsoft Developers Network Academic
Alliance (MSDN AA) which allows you to download certain Microsoft software
(including Windows 7) for free if used for academic purposes.
<p>
Alternatively, the ECE Department's IT services offers a "Virtual" computer lab
which you can remotely access from your Mac (or Windows machine). When you
access one of these Remote Desktops using your UT EID, any information you save
will be permanently stored on the Remote Desktop and only accessible to you.
</p>
<p>
Even if you do not own a Mac, the information on this page, especially the MSDN
AA instructions, is likely to be useful to you.
</p>

<h2>MSDN AA Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Enable your UTEID to use the engineering computer resources if you have
	not already done so by visiting <a
		href="https://apps.engr.utexas.edu/dnapps/EnableAccount/default.aspx">
		https://apps.engr.utexas.edu/dnapps/EnableAccount/default.aspx</a>. </li>
	<li>Go to <a href="http://www.engr.utexas.edu/itg/products/434-msdn">

<h2>Using ECE IT's Remote Desktop "Virutal LRC" Service:</h2>
	<code>https://vlrc.ae.utexas.edu/</code><br/>
</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	The first step is enable your Austin domain account if you have not already
	done so:
	<ol>
		<li>Go to <a
			href="https://apps.engr.utexas.edu/dnapps/EnableAccount/default.aspx">
			https://apps.engr.utexas.edu/dnapps/EnableAccount/default.aspx</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Log in using your UT EID.</li>
		<li>Check the &quot;I have read and agree to this policy&quot; box and
		click on &quot;Continue to Request Access&quot;.</li>
		<li>You should be good to go. You may click on the "Select Optional
		Services" button if you wish, but it is possible that no optional
		services show up here for you.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Next, you need to download and install the software required to access
	the "Virtual LRC":
	<ol>
		<li>Go to <a href="https://vdesk.utexas.edu/">
			https://vdesk.utexas.edu/</a>. What do at the link depends on what
		operating system you're running.
		<ul>
			<li>On Windows:
			<ol>
				<li>The link should tell you to download a standalone View
				Client.</li>
				<li>Make sure you <b>DO NOT</b> download the option with "Local
				Mode".</li>
				<li>Download the installer and run it. Install every feature.</li>
				<li>It'll ask you for a default server address, and you can use
				"https://vdesk.utexas.edu/" (do not include the quotes).</li>
				<li>The installer will ask you to restart your machine. Restart
				your machine.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>On Mac/Linux:
			<ol>
				<li>You will also need need a standalone View Client.</li>
				<li>You can either download the option provided to you at the link,
				or use the one at <a
					href="http://code.google.com/p/vmware-view-open-client/">
					http://code.google.com/p/vmware-view-open-client/</a>. </li>
				<li>Download and install your View Client of choice. Follow all
				directions during installation by clicking on
				"Next"/"OK"/"Yes"/"Accept"/"Continue" as necessary.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Once you've installed a view client, open it up and enter
		https://vdesk.utexas.edu as the server URL and connect to it. This may
		take some time.</li>
		<li>Connecting should have taken you to a login window - use your UT EID
		and Password to login; the domain is AUSTIN. This may take some
		time.</li>
		<li>You should be confronted with a choice of which machines to log into.
		Choose "ECE vDesk Lab". The Windows Desktop should load and you should be
		ready to start using it! This may take some time.</li>
		<li>You can save files onto this Windows Desktop, and they will be
		private to you and still available the next time you log in. Backing up
		important files is suggested, especially for programming assignments in
		this class. You can do this by emailing files to you or whatever other
		method you're comfortable with. Remember, you are responsible for
		maintaining the security of your files! <b>Do not</b> allow anyone to see
		your programming assignment files.</li>
	</ol>
