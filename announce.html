Exam 1 will be during class time (5:00 - 6:30 PM) this Wednesday, October 8. We recommend you arrive at least 5 minutes early so that you have plenty of time to take the exam. Please read the following guidelines carefully before Wednesday:

    <li> Failure to follow directions will result in a 0. No exceptions. </li>
